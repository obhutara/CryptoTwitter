@book{drescher2017blockchain,
  abstract = {In 25 concise steps, you will learn the basics of blockchain technology. Mathematical formulas, program code, and computer science jargon are not used. No previous knowledge in computer science, mathematics, programming, or cryptography is required.  Terminology is explained through pictures, analogies, and metaphors. This book bridges the gap that exists between purely technical books about the blockchain and purely business-focused books. It does so by explaining both the technical concepts that make up the blockchain and their role in business-relevant applications.What You Will Learn:What the blockchain isWhy it is needed and what problem it solvesWhy there is so much excitement about the blockchain and its potentialMajor components and their purposeHow components work and interactLimitations, why they exist, and what has been done to overcome themMajor application scenarios Who This Book Is For:The primary readership is professionals of the financial industry, including team leaders, project managers, business analysts, consultants, bankers, brokers, interbank dealers, asset managers, traders, insurance brokers, custodians, policy makers, and regulators. The secondary readership is students of business, economics, and law. },

  abstract = {Logistic regression analysis of high-dimensional data, such as natural language text, poses computational and statistical challenges. Maximum likelihood estimation often fails in these applications. We present a simple Bayesian logistic regression approach that uses a Laplace prior to avoid overfitting and produces sparse predictive models for text data. We apply this approach to a range of document classification problems and show that it produces compact predictive models at least as effective as those produced by support vector machine classifiers or ridge logistic regression combined with feature selection. We describe our model fitting algorithm, our open source implementations (BBR and BMR), and experimental results.},
